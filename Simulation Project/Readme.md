Parts of population: Respondents, Late Respondents, Non-Respondents
Seasons: Summer, Winter 
Datasets: CRCs, % on time by year, Survey data, % late by year
Possible Simulated datasets:
1.	Null hypothesis: Total population from reported CRCs -->  No difference between on time, late, don’t respond
2.	Use reported CRCs to simulate respondent and late population, use survey data to simulate non-respondent population --> Assumes late population is more similar to group who reported since they did report, just late
3.	Use reported CRCs to simulate respondent population, use survey data to simulate late population --> Assumes late population is more similar to group who didn’t report since they did not submit before the deadline

First Steps (SUMMER ONLY):
1. Visualize catch/card for CRC data and survey data - by year, aggregated
2. Visualize distribution of % on-time and late cards
3. Fit probability distribution to CRC respondent data - aggregate, mail-in, online - by year or total across years
4. Fit probability distribution to Survey data from non-respondents - by year or total across years
5. Fit probability distribution to % on-time cards (total, mail in, online) - data available in most recent memo
6. Fit probability distribution to % late cards (use place holder until available)
