### Puget Sound Crab Recreational Harvest Estimation 

This repository includes the code and data used to generate harvest estimates based on reported CRCs. There are two separate functions, one for summer estimates and another for winter estimates. All the data and inputs needed to run the functions are provided under the **CRC Data** folder. 


Currently, this repo also contains the cleaned crab creel data from the 2023 Puget Sound pilot creel study along with the associated metadata. This information can be found under the **Creel Data** folder.
