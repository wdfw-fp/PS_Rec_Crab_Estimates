### Puget Sound Crab Recreational Harvest Estimation 

This repository includes the code and data used to generate harvest estimates based on reported CRCs. There are two separate functions, one for summer estimates and another for winter estimates. All the data and inputs needed to run the functions are provided under the **CRC Data** folder. 
We have also supplied all the data and analysis used to produce the partitioning catch amoung Marina Areas to better align with the quota management areas used for harvest management. The partitioning survey data was used to produce the 2024 harvest estimates. These files can be found under the the **Partitioning Survey** folder. 


Currently, this repo also contains the cleaned crab creel data from the 2023 Puget Sound pilot creel study along with the associated metadata. This information can be found under the **Creel Data** folder.
